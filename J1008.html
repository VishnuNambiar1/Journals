1.1:
It says “outside of the merlin directory”.

2.1:
It says I am in “Merlin Root”.

2.2:
What missions I have available to do.

3.1:
Merlin prepare has added multiple directories to my directory listing.

3.2:
I think the command “prepare” makes sure all the missions are transferred into the main directory chosen.

4.1:
It has created many new files into the directory of the specific mission I went into.

4.2:
The purpose of the prepare command is to prepare the specific directory so new directories/files can be put into it by the command itself.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned how to start and finish merlin missions.

What challenges did I encounter?
Nothing much, I just needed permissions to be able to access merlin missions.

How could this be improved?
This could be improved by directly showing how to do this through a video format, where a person properly explains and demonstrates it.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
It hasn't really impacted my thinking, but I have learned a little bit more on how to do merlin missions.
