I have recivied assisteance from: No one

I assisted: No one

1.1:
Git is telling me that I committed something as well as who committed it and when it was committed.

1.2:
I see that the log uses the word commit, so the previous commit that I used is probably logged in here.

1.3:
This is because the log is supposed to track what I did related to git.

2.1:
I noticed that file 1 and file 2 are both only in the working directory. They are both said to be not staged for commit.

2.2:
No, they are not staged in the same section. This is because file1.txt previously existed and was altered. File2.txt was just recently created, causing this one to be considered as untracked, whereas file1.txt is just not staged for commit.

3.1:
They are considered as changes to be committed. They are in the same section.

3.2:
They are in the same section, however file1 says it is modified and file2 says it is a new file.

4.1:
2 files are listed as changed.

4.2:
The specific difference shown for file1 is that I added “This is a new line”. The specific difference shown for file2 is that I added “This is a new line in a new file”.

5.1:
2 files changed and  2 insertions were made.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned how to commit and push files onto GitHub.

What challenges did I encounter?
Nothing much, I had a hard time getting this file on the repository however.

How could this be improved?
This could be improved by directly showing how to do this through a video format, where a person properly explains and demonstrates it.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
It hasn't really impacted my thinking, but I have a little bit better of an understanding of GitHub.
