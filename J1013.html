1.1:
That symbol is an equivalence symbol with a cross on it. The equivalence symbol basically means that if both values are true or false, the resulting value is true. The exclusive disjunction is basically the complete opposite of equivalence, so by putting a cross on the equivalence symbol, it makes sense that it would represent exclusive disjunction.

2.1:
This is because you have to consider the relationship between each input, so 2^n helps to identify the amount of relations these inputs will have with one another before finding the relations in the first place.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned about the truth table, and the big idea was Boolean Algebra.

What challenges did I encounter?
Nothing much, just had trouble figuring out what the truth table meant.

How could this be improved?
This could be improved by directly showing how to solve truth table problems and the direct use of these symbols in example problems.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
I completely understand the truth table and boolean algebra. It gives me a new idea of variables with true and false values.
