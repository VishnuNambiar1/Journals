1.1:
Basically, you combine the right most column, carry over the remaining values, and then add that into the second column, and continue this process until you are complete.

2.1:
You have to be careful as the octal values only have 8 digits, so carry when a column becomes 8 or greater.

3.1:
Hexadecimal numbers have 16 digits, where capital letters are the last 6 digits. One unique thing about them is that they can be very large. Each column to the left is one greater power of 16 than the right.

4.1:
It is a really low base, so the numbers can get very large very quickly. You may have to carry often as the maximum value that can be in a column is 1.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned about Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal numbers and how to add them.

What challenges did I encounter?
Nothing much, just had a little struggle in figuring out bases.

How could this be improved?
This could be improved by directly showing how to solve base problems through videos. Maybe link a khan academy video that might help to explain.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
I completely understand bases and how to manipulate them through mathematical processes.
